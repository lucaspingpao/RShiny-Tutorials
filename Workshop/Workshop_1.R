# Problem 1: print any (school-appropriate) message to the console that you'd like!
# Your code here for Problem 1

# Problem 2: create two (school-appropriate) strings and print them in one command by pasting them together.
# Your code here for Problem 2

# Problem 3: create a vector consisting of the first five positive integers in increasing order.
  # Then, create a vector consisting of the first five negative integers (-1 through -5) in decreasing order.
  # Compute and print the component-wise sum of those vectors.
  # Compute and print the component-wise product of those vectors.
  # Write the results in a comment below your code.
  # Concatenate the two vectors and print the result.
  # Stack the first vector on top of the second vector as a 2-row matrix and print the result.
  # Combine the vectors as a 2-column matrix (first then second) and print the result.
  # Retrieve and print the first row of the 2-column matrix you just created.
  # Retrieve and print the element in the first row, third column of the 2-row matrix.
  # Retrieve and print the second column of the 2-row matrix.
  
# Your code here for Problem 3

# Problem 4: combine your two vectors from Problem 3 into a list.
  # Retrieve and print the second element of this list.
  # Name the elements of your list "first element" and "second element"
  # Retrieve the first element of the list using its name.

# Problem 5: write a loop that prints every odd number from 1 to 20, inclusive.

# Problem 6: write a function that computes the average (mean) of a vector of elements.
  # Call that function on the example vectors c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and c(2, 4, -5, 9).
