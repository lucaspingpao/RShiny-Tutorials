# Problem 1: you have four siblings - Alex, Blake, Charlie, and Diane.
  # They each randomly pull a number from a hat between 1 and 39, inclusive.
  # Their birth months are each random numbers between 1 - 12, inclusive.
  # Create and print a data frame with these three columns of information.
  # Print the first row of this data frame.
  # Name the columns "name", "hat", and "month", and print the "hat" column using its name.
# Your code for Problem 1 here

# Problem 2: continuing with the data frame from Problem 1, compute and print all the information for the people who are born between January and June, inclusive.
# Your code for Problem 2 here

# Problem 3: similar to the multiplication table created in class, create an addition table for the numbers 1:7.
  # Then, compute and print the mean, median, minimum, and maximum of the whole table.
  # Compute and print the mean, median, minimum, and maximum of the fifth column of the table.
  # Compute and print the mean, median, minimum, and maximum of each row of the table, using 4 lines of code.
# Your code for Problem 3 here

# Problem 4: generate two vectors of length 100 each, where each entry is a number between 1 and 100, inclusive.
  # Plot a scatterplot of the two vectors (one of them should be the x-axis, and the other one should be the y-axis).
